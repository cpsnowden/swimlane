# Swim Lane

Swim Lane is a side-project aimed at showing lap swimming lane availability accross
different UK swimming pools (operated by different vendors).

## Design

### Lane Availability Data Sources

The project is predicated on the availability of lane availability data from the
different vendors. Hence I will initially focus on determining feasible data sourcing for 3 example vendors which operate pools in Central London.

1. Everyone Active (https://www.everyoneactive.com)
   - Queen Mother Leisure Center (Victoria)
   - The Castle Center (Elephant and Castle)
2. Better (http://better.org.uk)
   - Vauxhall Leisure Center
   - Chelsea Sports Center
   - London Aquatics Center (Stratford)
3. Active Lambeth (http://active.lambeth.gov.uk)
   - Clapham Leisure Centre (formerly operated by Better)
